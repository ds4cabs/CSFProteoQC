Exploration of Blood Contamination Effects on CSF Biomarker Analysis in Clinical Samples

The integrity of biomarkers in clinical diagnostics is pivotal for accurate disease diagnosis, prognosis, and subsequent therapeutic strategies. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a particularly valuable biological fluid used in the diagnosis of neurological disorders due to its direct interaction with the brain and spinal cord. Among various biomarkers, some biomarkers have gained prominence due to its association with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. However, the reliability of biomarker quantification can be compromised by blood contaminationâ€”a frequent complication arising during CSF collection.

This project, titled "CSF-BiomarkQC: Ensuring the Integrity of Neurological Biomarkers", aims to systematically explore the impact of blood contamination on the quantification of CSF biomarkers. By simulating various levels of blood contamination and employing state-of-the-art proteomic techniques, including ELISA and mass spectrometry, this study intends to assess how even minimal blood intrusion can skew biomarker readings and mislead diagnostic conclusions.
